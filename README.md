# Time Series Forecast App

This is a Streamlit-based web application for forecasting stock price data using multiple time series models including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM.

---

## Project Description

This app helps visualize, analyze, and forecast stock prices (e.g., Google stock) using different forecasting models. It is built as part of a data science internship project and allows users to:

- Upload their own CSV time series data
- Choose a forecasting model (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- View plots of historical and predicted values
- Download forecast results (optional)

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA & SARIMA)
- Prophet (Facebook)
- Keras/TensorFlow (for LSTM)
